## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
###**My name is Whitney!**
####I am a full-time student at the University Of Phoenix and I am brand new to the coding community. I figured I'd try GitHub since I am getting a degree in Science, most specifically Cybersecurity. I am open to any help and any advice as I try to learn coding and everything else along with it.
